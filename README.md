**Project Goal:** Classification of resumes into distinct categories using machine learning techniques.

**Tools and Libraries:** Use of Python libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and NLP libraries like NLTK and TfidfVectorizer for preprocessing and modeling.

**Dataset:** Analysis of a dataset (UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv) to identify and classify categories of resumes.

**Techniques:** Includes text preprocessing (e.g., stopword removal, tokenization), feature extraction, and application of models like LSTM and K-Nearest Neighbors.

**Visualization:** Use of Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis and visualization of categories.
